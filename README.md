# Weather Dashboard App

## Description

The assignment was to build a weather dashboard app that displayed weather information for various cities. The app utilizes weather data retrieved from the OpenWeather API. The weather dashboard was to display weather information for the current date and 5-day weather forecast. The current day weather information includes information for temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a UV index. The UV index displays a color to indicate favorable weather conditions. A graphic icon representing the weather condition of the day is also displayed. The 5-day forecast section shows weather conditions expected for the following 5 days including temperature and humidity along with a graphic icon representing the expected conditions for that day.

There is a search field where the user can enter the desired city name for their search. Clicking the search button will initiate the retrieval of information to display in the GUI. All city name searches are stored in a list below a 'Clear History' button. Clicking the city name of a past search will redisplay the weather information for the date of that search. Clicking the 'Clear History' button will clear all saved search history information from storage.
